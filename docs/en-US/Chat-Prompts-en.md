Write text similarity analysis code using Python
```

**Reference output:**

```` markdown copy
Here's an example code for text similarity analysis using Python:

``` python
import re
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Define two text strings and preprocess them (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, etc.)
text1 = "This is a sample text for similarity analysis."
text2 = "This is another sample text for similarity analysis."

processed_text1 = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]", "", text1)  # Remove punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters
processed_text2 = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]", "", text2)  # Remove punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters

processed_text1 = processed_text1.lower()  # Convert all text to lowercase
processed_text2 = processed_text2.lower()  # Convert all text to lowercase

# Use TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction and vectorization, then calculate similarity score (cosine similarity)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()  # Create TF-IDF feature extractor and vectorizer object
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([processed_text1, processed_text2])  # Convert texts to TF-IDF matrix
similarity_score = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0], tfidf_matrix[1])[0][0]  # Calculate cosine similarity score

print("The similarity score between the two texts is:", similarity_score)
``` 

In the code above, we first define two text strings for comparison. Then, we use TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction and vectorization, converting them to TF-IDF matrix form. Finally, we use the cosine similarity function to calculate the similarity score between these two texts.

tips that in practical applications, adjustments and optimizations may be needed based on specific circumstances. For example, different feature extraction methods or word vector representation methods could be considered to improve model performance.

**Input prompts:**

``` markdown copy
In modern urban life, many people have high salaries but face high work pressure, and their happiness and freedom levels aren't necessarily high. Can you interpret this from social development and philosophical perspectives?
```
**Reference output**
``` markdown
In contemporary urban life, many people earn high salaries but may not experience high levels of happiness and freedom due to work pressure and time constraints. From social development and philosophical perspectives, we can interpret this phenomenon as follows:

1. Impact of Social Development on Happiness: With economic development and technological advancement, people's living standards have improved. However, this progress has also brought more competition and pressure. In such a fast-paced, high-intensity society, people often need to put in more effort to achieve corresponding rewards. Therefore, while pursuing material wealth and success, we also need to pay attention to maintaining physical and mental health and cultivating good interpersonal relationships.

2. Philosophical Reflection on the Relationship Between Happiness and Freedom: Philosophers believe that happiness is a subjective experience, while freedom is an objective condition. In modern urban life, although we have more opportunities and resources to pursue our desired lifestyle, we also face more challenges and pressures. Therefore, we need to deeply consider how to balance personal interests with social responsibilities, and how to achieve personal value while contributing to society.

3. Solutions: To improve happiness while maintaining freedom, we can take the following measures:
    - Establish healthy lifestyle habits: Maintaining good dietary habits, appropriate exercise, adequate sleep, etc., all help improve physical fitness and mental health.
    - Cultivate hobbies: Enrich life experiences through various cultural activities, travel, etc.
    - Build good interpersonal relationships: Maintain contact with family and friends, participate in social activities to help relieve work pressure and enhance happiness.
    - Find inner balance: While pursuing material wealth and success, don't forget to pay attention to inner needs. You can relax body and mind through meditation, yoga, and other methods to find inner balance.

In conclusion, in modern urban life, we need to recognize the complex relationship between happiness and freedom. Only by comprehensively considering the balance between personal interests and social responsibilities can we achieve true happiness and freedom.

**Input prompts**

``` markdown copy
Please help me summarize the architecture and theory of distributed systems, as well as industries applying this concept, and commonly used applications in the market
```
**Reference output**
``` markdown
A distributed system refers to a system composed of multiple independent computer nodes that are connected through a network to jointly complete certain tasks. The distributed system architecture can be divided into three layers: client, middleware, and database.

1. Client: Responsible for providing interface and interaction functions to users.
2. Middleware: Responsible for processing client requests and forwarding them to corresponding server nodes.
3. Database: Stores and manages data, provides access and query services.

The advantages of distributed systems lie in their ability to achieve high availability, high performance, and high scalability. For example, when one node fails, other nodes can still continue working; when system expansion is needed, new computer nodes can simply be added. Additionally, distributed systems also have features like fault tolerance and load balancing.

Currently, industries with widespread applications include finance, e-commerce, and logistics. For example, in the financial sector, banks use distributed systems to process large volumes of transactions; in e-commerce, platforms use distributed systems to support massive order processing; in logistics, companies use distributed systems to achieve rapid delivery.

In conclusion, with the continuous development and popularization of internet technology, distributed systems have become essential infrastructure across various industries. They offer advantages like efficiency, stability, and security, and will continue to be widely applied in the future.

What's the difference between indefinite and definite articles
```

**Reference output**
``` markdown
Indefinite and definite articles are two very important articles in English, used to indicate general and specific references. The indefinite articles "a" or "an" are used for general references, while the definite article "the" is used for specific references. Specifically, when we want to express an abstract concept, unknown thing, or something without a specific name, we need to use indefinite articles. For example:

- I need a book.
- She is a teacher.

When we want to express a specific person, thing, or concept, we need to use the definite article. For example:

- The cat is sleeping on the sofa.
- He is the best student in my class.

In conclusion, both indefinite and definite articles are very important in English, as they help us express ourselves more accurately.
